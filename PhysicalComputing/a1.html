          <p>
        Here is all the documentation for assignment 1. <br><br>

        Initial calculations: The LEDs that I used for this assignment need a current of 20 mA
        (milliamps) and require 1.8 V, so using Ohm's Law (V = I * R) for each individual LED:<br>
        5V - 3.2 V / 20 mA = R = 160 Ω<br><br>

        <img src="blinkdiagram.jpg" width="350">
        Above: This schematic is a representation of the actual circuit, which can be seen below.
        As can be seen, each pin is supplying 5V, while each circuit uses a 160 Ω resistor
        based on the calculations performed above.<br><br>

        <img src="blinkcircuit.jpg" width="350">
        Above: Here is the actual circuit, based on the schematic. I used one each of a red, yellow,
        and green LED.<br><br>

        This is the code which I used:<br>

        <code>
          // Turns on and off three LEDs for 1 second each, in succession<br>
          // Partly based on code from Arduino's example Blink.ino<br>

          // Sets up the pins to be used for each color<br>
          int redPin = 2; // Red LED to pin #2<br>
          int yelPin = 3; // Yellow LED to pin #3<br>
          int grnPin = 4; // Green LED to pin #4<br>

          // Setup function to configure the correct pins (2-4) for the LEDs<br>
          void setup() { // Setup function<br>
            pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT); // Red LED pin set to output<br>
            pinMode(yelPin, OUTPUT); // Yellow LED pin set to output<br>
            pinMode(grnPin, OUTPUT); // Green LED pin set to output<br>
          }<br>

          // Continuously lights up the red, yellow, and green LEDs in turn<br>
          void loop() { // Contiuously loops<br>
            for (int j = 2; j <= redPin + 2; j++) { // Starts at the red pin and cycles 
                through all three<br>
              digitalWrite(j, HIGH), // Lights up LED (HIGH)<br>
              delay(1000); // LED stays illuminated for 1s<br>
              digitalWrite(j, LOW); // Turns off LED (LOW)<br>
              delay(1000); // Waits 1s for next LED to light<br>
            }<br>
          }<br><br>
        </code>

        1. Graph:<br>
        <img src="blinkgraph.jpg" width="350">
        Above: Graph of voltage over time for each LED. The graph shows how each LED is powered
        in turn, with a 1 second pause in between.<br><br>
        2. Because each LED is connected to an individual pin on the Arduino, the number that
          I could blink independently is mainly limited by the number of pins. In my current
          setup, I can blink 3 LEDs with one attached to each pin. If I were limited by the 5V
          current from each pin (multiple LEDs on a single pin), I would be able to blink two
          of the red, yellow, or green pins or one of the white or blue pins. <br><br>
        4. At around 20 ms, it became hard to tell what order the LEDs were blinking in. At
          around 5 ms, I began to be unable to tell if the LEDs were blinking at all.<br><br>
        5. I did not use AI tools while completing this assignment.<br><br>
